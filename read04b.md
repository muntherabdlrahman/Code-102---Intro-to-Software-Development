>Have you just ask yourself how the computer work ?

###### Let me say firt what is the computers.

### computer is: 
##### machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device

##### The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, takes over and processes the information it was given. Once the data is ready, it will be sent back through an output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.

###### To better imagine how a computer works, knowing what’s inside will make it easier. Here are the main components of a computer:


CPU| or Central Processing Unit is considered the most important component in a computer and for good reason
-|- 
RAM|Random Access Memory, or RAM for short, is a computer component where data used by the operating system and software applications store data so that the CPU can process them quickly.
HDD|Also known as Hard Disk Drive, it is the component where photos, apps, documents and such are kept. Although they are still being used, we have much faster types of storage devices such as solid state drives (SSD) that are also more reliable.
Motherboard|Motherboard, There is no acronym for this component but without it, there can’t be a computer. The Motherboard acts as the home for all other components, allows them to communicate with each other and gives them power in order to function. 
Video and   Sound   Cards|Video and   Sound   Cards,  components which help the user interact with the computer. Although one can use a computer with a missing sound card, it’s not really possible to use it without a video card.
Network adapter|Network adapter,  Even though it is not actually required to operate the computer, the Network adapter improves the user’s experience as it provides access to the internet.



###### If you are having trouble with any of your computer’s internal or external components, please do not hesitate to contact Geeks on Site. Our experienced techs are ready to help you with any computer issues and are often able to do so remotely by walking you through a few steps to give them access to your computer.


***Binary and Data***
###### is a type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system. Binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer. It is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones.


***Circuits and Logic***
###### computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit. Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate. The smallest circuit is a chain of 2 logic gates.


The basic logic gates are classified into seven types: AND gate, OR gate, XOR gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, XNOR gate, and NOT gate. The truth table is used to show the logic gate function. All the logic gates have two inputs except the NOT gate, which has only one input.



>Boolean Logic is a form of algebra which is centered around three simple words known as Boolean Operators: “Or,” “And,” and “Not”. At the heart of Boolean Logic is the idea that all values are either true or false.




***Input/output***

######  devices are the pieces of hardware used by a human (or other system) to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard or computer mouse is an input device for a computer, while monitors and printers are output devices.



***Software and hardware***
###### hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer's hard drive.

###### Word processing software uses the computer processor, memory, and hard drive to generate and save documents. In a computer, hardware is what makes a computer work.

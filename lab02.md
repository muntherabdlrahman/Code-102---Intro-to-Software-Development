##### Every long-distance runner is familiar with the idea of pacing. When you’re trying to go a certain distance, it’s the speed that—if you successfully maintain it—will get you to the finish line on time.


4.**Criticism**

##### he definition of criticism is to expressing disapproval, or a literary analysis of something by taking a detailed look at the pros, cons and merits. When you tell someone he is lazy, this is an example of criticism.

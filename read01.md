# ***Mastering Markdown***
>Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Why Use Markdown?

ðŸ”¢
*1.Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.*

ðŸ”¢
2.Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you donâ€™t like the Markdown application youâ€™re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. Thatâ€™s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

ðŸ”¢
3.Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.

ðŸ”¢
4.Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

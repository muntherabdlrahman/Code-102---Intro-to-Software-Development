# JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY

This book explains how JavaScript can be used 
in browsers to make websites more interactive, 
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about 
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

1|Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.
2|learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you  need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
3|becoming familiar with how  it is applied by looking at  examples of how JavaScript  is commonly used in websites today.   


>Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:

- [x] Access the content of the page 
- [x] Modify the content of the page 
- [x] Program rules or instructions the browser can follow 
- [x] React to events triggered by the user or browser 

>Start with the big picture of what 
you want to achieve, and break 
that down into smaller steps. 

1- *DEFINE THE GOAL 
First, you need to define the task you want to 
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the 
computer to solve.*   

2- *DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
To design a script you split the goal out into a series 
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this 
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. 
You can then write down individual steps that the 
computer needs to perform in order to complete 
each individual task (and any information it needs to 
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it 
can follow.* 

*3: CODE EACH STEP 
Each of the steps needs to be written in a 
programming language that the compu ter 
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. 
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight 
away, it pays to spend time designing your script 
before you start writing it.*




### SCRIPT 

***To write a script, you need to first 
state your goal and then list the 
tasks that need to be completed in 
order to achieve it. 
Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking 
about them too much, for example you might be 
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email 
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first 
time we do these things they can seem daunting.***

>Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break 
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at 
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow 
familiar and seem simpler.

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 


No|--
--|--
1|The name must begin with  a letter, dollar sign ($),or an  underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 
2|he name can contain letters,  numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3|annot use keywords or  reserved words. Keywords  are special words that tell the  interpreter to do something. For  example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved \ words are ones that may be used  in a future version of JavaScript.  ONLINE EXTRA  View a full list of keywords and  reserved words in JavaScript. 
4|All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases


## ARRAYS
> You should consider using an 
array whenever you are working 
with a list or a set of values that 
are related to each other. 
Arrays are especially helpful 
when you do not know how 
many items a list will contain 
because, when you create the 
array, you do not need to specify 
how many values it will hold. 
If you don't know how many 
items a list will contain, rather 
than creating enough variables 
for a long list (when you might 
only use a small percentage 
of them), using an array is 
considered a better solution.  


>* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 

>* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 

>* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
